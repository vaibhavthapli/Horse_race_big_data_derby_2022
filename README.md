## Problem Statement
Punters have access to information available on the HKJC website, with veterinary and trackwork record available at the click of a button. There are many factors that could affect the race result and millions have tried to find a winning formula in order to make a profit from betting. We did a simple test to see what would happen if we had bet $1 on every horse with the lowest odds. Theoretically, this should work since the horse with the lowest odds tends to be the favourite. Our results showed otherwise.

And so the problem we want to address here is: 

**Can we use machine learning to make predictions to profit from horse races?**

We will follow the data science process to answer this problem.
1. Define the problem
2. Gather & clean the data
3. Explore the data
4. Model the data
5. Evaluate the model
6. Answer the problem
